## Emotion Detection in Images using DeepFace
This Python script uses the DeepFace library to analyze the emotion in an image. It detects faces in the image and determines the dominant emotion expressed by each face.

# Installation
To use this script, you need to install the DeepFace library. You can install it using pip:


# Copy code
# pip install deepface
You also need to have OpenCV and Matplotlib installed:


pip install opencv-python matplotlib
# Usage
Place the image you want to analyze in the same directory as the script.
Update the img_path variable in the script to point to your image file.
Run the script. It will display the image with bounding boxes around the detected faces and labels indicating the dominant emotion for each face.
